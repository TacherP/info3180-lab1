    <p>Lush vegetation, sun kiss beaches with sparkling black and white sands, crystal clear rivers, friendly people are some words I use to describe the country where I am from, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. I love nature and I am intrigued by the way the world and everything in it is gravitating to technological change.</p>
