    <p>Lush vegetation, sun kiss beaches with sparkling black and white sands, crystal clear rivers, friendly people are some words I would use to describe my home country St. Vincent and the Grenadines. I am intrigued by the way the world and everything in it is gravitating to technological change. I love nature, hiking and discovering beautiful hidden scenery. On a regular sunny day I would prefer to pack food, drinks and literally anything I can carry that would make the day enjoyable and go to the beach with friends and family. What more can I say about myself? Oh yes, I love to document finding and share pictures with the media. In regards to why I choose an IT degree, I Choose this degree because I am interesting in navigate with all the technological changes and for oppurtunities to work alongside other Technican/IT Specialist to formulate how we can use technology to extend the life span of the earth's natural materials based on current evidence of the negative domination of climate change.</p>
